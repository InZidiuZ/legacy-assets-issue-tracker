# legacy-assets-issue-tracker

All asset-related stuff for Legacy is to be posted here! If you have any suggestion for new vehicles, maps, or similar, feel free to suggest them here. Any asset-related bugs, such as vehicle issues, are also to be reported here.

## Whats the difference between "script" and "asset" issues?

### [Script Issues](https://github.com/InZidiuZ/op-framework-issue-tracker)
Script issues involve problems or suggestions related to the activities, interactions, and features within the game that require coding to function. For example, if you encounter a problem with a job or a heist in the game not working as expected, that's a script issue. It also includes adding new activities like jobs, heists, or items, as well as fixing bugs in these features. If there's an issue with the game's user interface, like a menu not displaying correctly, or if a new feature needs to be added to the game, these are also script issues. Essentially, anything that involves creating or fixing the interactive parts of the game falls under this category. Script issues should go [here](https://github.com/InZidiuZ/op-framework-issue-tracker) instead of in this issue tracker.

### [Asset Issues](https://github.com/InZidiuZ/legacy-assets-issue-tracker)
Asset issues are related to the visual and physical elements in the game. This includes the creation or modification of maps and buildings, designing new 3D models for props, vehicles, and weapons, and adjusting how these items look and behave. For instance, if a vehicle's appearance or handling needs adjustment, or if there are problems with how a building or object looks or interacts with the environment (like broken textures or collisions), these are asset issues. Additionally, creating or updating vehicle liveries and fixing any graphical glitches also fall under this category. In short, if it’s about what you see and interact with physically in the game, it’s an asset issue.
